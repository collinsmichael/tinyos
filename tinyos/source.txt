the source code is divided into 5 branches
  o kernel
  o shell
  o devices
  o library
  o userland

the kernel is responsible for initialization and logon
the shell allows users to execute userland programs by name
devices are exposed as file streams.
library houses a minimalist c runtime.
userland is where programs such as echo, and chat are kept.


the system includes a basic memory manager, standard input output,
and a commandline interpretter.

in debug builds all hardware IO is avoided and instead input
and output is achieved by reading/writing arrays.

the keyboard array in "source/devices/keyboard.c"
there lives a char array that acts as user input.
this char array is interpretted by the shell and programs
are executed.
